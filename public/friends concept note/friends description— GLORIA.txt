*PRODUCT STORY — GLORIA* 

 *1. CLEAN SLATES* 

(Off-White & White)
Alternative title: FRIENDS

 *Story* 

Before anything existed, there was space.
A quiet beginning.
An untouched surface.

Clean Slates represents the divine permission to begin again.
It is the belief that life is not handed to us finished but entrusted to us unfinished.

White is not emptiness here.
It is potential.

It carries the courage to decide:

who walks with you,

what memories you keep,

what kind of love you allow,

and what kind of world you insist on building.


Clean Slates is the understanding that eternity is immersive
that every day, every friendship, every choice is ink on a canvas that was never meant to be crowded by fear or limitation.

This product is not about perfection.
It is about ownership.

The world is yours.
The story is yours.
The slate is clean—because you are still becoming.


 *2. SUBTLE SOPHISTICATION* 

(Beige Pink )

 *Story* 

Beige does not announce itself.
It arrives.

Subtle Sophistication is elegance without effort

the kind that doesn’t compete, doesn’t rush, doesn’t explain itself.

It is found in:

knowing who you are,

being comfortable in your skin,

choosing restraint over noise,

and presence over performance.


Beige holds warmth without demanding attention.
It understands that the most powerful people in the room are often the calmest.

This colour is for those who have nothing to prove
only something to be.

Subtle Sophistication is a quiet confidence.
A grounded identity.
A reminder that elegance is not loud
it is lived.
